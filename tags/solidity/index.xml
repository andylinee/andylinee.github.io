      <description>Solidity supports two types of callback functions, namely receive() and fallback(), primarily used for the following scenarios:&#xA;Receiving $ETH Handling function calls that do not exist in the contract Receive function: receive() receive() is a function called when a contract receives an $ETH transfer. A contract can have at most one receive() function. The declaration of receive() differs from other functions; it does not require the function keyword, cannot have any parameters, cannot return any value, and must include external and payable: receive() external payable { .</description>

      <title>Understanding call, staticcall and delegatecall in Solidity</title>

      <description>call, staticcall, and delegatecall are all low-level ways to call functions in another contract. They all allow adjusting the gas limit (compared to transfer and send, which have a fixed limit of 2300 gas) and do not throw exceptions when a call error occurs; instead, they return false. The main differences between these three calling methods are as follows:&#xA;call: Can call functions in other contracts (which can change the state of the called contract, the calling function cannot be view), can be used for transfers (parameter value), and can adjust gas settings.</description>
